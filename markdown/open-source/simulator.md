To develop more tools for Apple-platform developers in Swift, the ecosystem lacks Swift libraries that have been available for programming languages Ruby. One of those libraries is [simctl](https://github.com/plu/simctl), an abstraction for Xcode `simctl` tool to interact with Xcode simulators.

[Simulator](https://github.com/angledotdev/simulator) can be seen as a port of that library to Swift. It's one of the core pieces of [Angle](https://www.github.com/angledotdev), and has been developed as an independent package/dependency so that other developers can leverage it from their projects.
