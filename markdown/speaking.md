# Speaking

## Proposals

In this section you'll find some talk proposals that I wrote up and that I'd love to present at any conference. If you would like me to give this talk anywhere, don't hesitate to email me at <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}" target="_blank">mailto:pedro@ppinera.es</a>.

### All you need is tools

Developers architect apps, write software, develop new features, and attend conferences like WWDC to learn and bring the new exciting features into their apps. To do so, they use Apple’s official tools like Xcode, and open source projects like CocoaPods or Fastlane. Those are powerful tools but designed and optimized to meet the needs of any sort of project: large, small, written in Swift, but also in Objective-C, for solo developers and for large teams.

When projects start getting far off the standards for which the tools are optimized, the tools and services can turn into a source of issues. Those usually hold the teams back from being productive and delivering a high-quality final product.

In this talk, I'll talk about **why** investing effort into developing your own tools is crucial to move on steadily with motivated and productive developers. Furthermore, I'll give attendees some tips to know **when** is the right time to do such investment, and go through some **real examples** of impactful tools that my team has developed to bring best practices and conventions across the whole organization.

With this talk, I expect the attendees to get the motivation to question their own workflows and tools, lose the fear of developing tooling themselves, and be able to justify their project stakeholders why the right tooling is often source of great products and motivated teams.  

### Orchestrating mobile app releases with Ruby and Rails

Coordinating mobile app releases is a tedious and long process for which many companies have a dedicated person. Release captains, as they are often called, take a lot of responsibility by becoming a point person. They have to trigger scripts that might be broken, ping stakeholders to share release notes or decide whether a last-minute fix can be included or not.

At Shopify, with several apps in the stores, that model was not sustainable at our scale. Thus, we designed and developed a platform, Shipit Mobile, that orchestrates the process. It takes most of the responsibility away from the captain, makes the process convenient, and provides a framework to make and share decisions with confidence.

In this talk, I’ll talk about how my team, with zero experience in Rails at that time, embarked on designing and building the platform from scratch. Among others, we’ll see the challenges of standardizing the process and the coordination with third-party services like CI, GitHub and the store APIs. Moreover, I’ll share how the process of developing an internal service at Shopify looks, and how we leveraged our design system, Polaris, to move fast and build a product that is consistent and aligned with the company.
